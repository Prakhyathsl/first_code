            "Crocodiles have been around for over 200 million years, making them one of the oldest living reptiles.",
            "Crocodiles have one of the strongest bites in the animal kingdom, with a force of up to 3,700 pounds per square inch.",
            "They are excellent ambush predators, often lying in wait for hours before striking at their prey with lightning speed.",
            "Crocodiles can go through 4,000 teeth over a lifetime, as they continuously replace them.",
            "As ectothermic animals, crocodiles rely on external heat sources to regulate their body temperature.",
            "They can swim up to 20 miles per hour using their powerful tails.",
            "Crocodiles are one of the few reptiles that can communicate vocally, using a variety of sounds to express different needs.",
            "Unlike many reptiles, crocodile mothers are known for their parental care, often guarding their nests and helping hatchlings reach water.",
            "While they primarily eat fish and mammals, crocodiles have been known to consume fruit, making them opportunistic feeders.",
            "Crocodiles can live up to 70 years in the wild, with some species living even longer in captivity.",
            "Some species, like the saltwater crocodile, have special glands that allow them to excrete excess salt, enabling them to live in saline environments.",
            "Crocodiles are often seen basking in groups, which helps them regulate their body temperature and socialize.",
            "They have a special transparent eyelid called a nictitating membrane that protects their eyes underwater.",
            "Crocodiles have a four-chambered heart, similar to birds and mammals, which is unique among reptiles.",
            "Crocodiles hold significant cultural importance in many societies, often symbolizing strength and power."
